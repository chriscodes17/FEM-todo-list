## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

During this challenge I learned how to create variables in CSS and how to utilize them when using the light/dark mode theme switching.

I enjoyed working through the filter feature where the user can filter their todos based on the status (complete, active, all). Whenever the user clicks on a filter button, the filteredTodos variable will change based on the if statements and the filter state and display only the required todos.

```js
let filteredTodos = todos;
const todoCount = todos.filter((todo) => !todo.isComplete).length;
if (filter === "active") {
  filteredTodos = filteredTodos.filter((todo) => !todo.isComplete);
} else if (filter === "completed") {
  filteredTodos = filteredTodos.filter((todo) => todo.isComplete);
}
```
This challenge was a great exercise for CSS styling and try to match the figma designs.
